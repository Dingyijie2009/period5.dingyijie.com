        <div class="overview-description">
          <p>
            Game developers create interactive games that people play on consoles,
            computers, and mobile devices. They help turn ideas, stories, and designs
            into fully working games.
          </p>

          <p>
            This career combines creativity and technical skills. Developers work with
            code, art, sound, and gameplay systems to make sure the game is fun and runs
            smoothly. They often work as part of a team where each person has a specific role.
          </p>

          <p>
            Game development requires patience and problem-solving because bugs and errors
            are common. Developers must test, adjust, and improve the game many times before release.
          </p>

          <h2>What they do daily</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Team Meetings:</strong> Discuss tasks, deadlines, and progress with the team.</li>
            <li><strong>Development:</strong> Write code, design levels, or create art assets.</li>
            <li><strong>Bug Fixing:</strong> Find problems in the game and fix them.</li>
            <li><strong>Playtesting:</strong> Play the game to improve balance and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Record changes so the team stays organized.</li>
            <li><strong>Learning:</strong> Practice new tools, engines, and programming skills.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Every day can be different, depending on the stage of the project. Early stages
            focus on ideas and prototypes, while later stages focus on polishing and fixing issues.
